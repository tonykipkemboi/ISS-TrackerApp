# ISS Tracker App

This is a simple app that tracks the current location of the ISS and Astronauts on board the ISS.

(ISS == _International Space Station_)

## Description

I am a space enthusiast and this project is a fun way for me to keep polishing my programming skills while engaging with 
a topic I like; you know, space 'n stuff.

I got the inspiration for this project from [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/where-is-the-space-station) 
and I will be continuously adding my own twist as time goes.

Some quick Facts about the ISS [Sources:WikiPedia & NASA]:
